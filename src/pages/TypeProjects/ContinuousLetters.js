        paragraph1="During the first lockdown of 2020 I decided to make my first typeface. Iâ€™ve always loved and worked with typography and letters but this was the first time I put my skills and experience together to make a typeface. It was a huge learning process which raised more questions than it answered, but I really enjoyed it."
        paragraph2="The concept of Continuous is simple, can I create an alphabet of letters and numbers where each letter is made of a single, non-overlapping stroke. Some letters were more challenging than others and I created some pretty wild glyphs, but I am pretty happy with the outcome of the project so far."
        paragraph3="I have created one weight of Continuous, displayed below, which will be available for download soon. I will be continuing to develop Continuous into multiple weights in the future, along with other new type projects."
